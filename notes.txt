To Do:




Semantics/Style/Practice
- Commiting
    - Commit for every "chunk" of work that makes sense. Better to commit more often than not. 
        - Ex: one commit to code footer, or split it into two parts and label them in your message
    - No need to commit w/message if it's just minor edits

Questions While Coding;
- Should we test by copying and pasting this code into birthdays to use the API key of Birthdays lab?
- Test database with php?
- Do we want the navbar to be displayed the same for every page? Or only when a user registers they get access to the tests?
