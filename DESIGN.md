# CelebritiesAndPersonalities

The Cap (Celebrities and personalities) App matches users with celebrities based on similarities between them. 

# Collaboration Considerations

In order to effectively collaborate on this project and learn new skills that we can use in the future, our group used our Github accounts to create our project and collaborate on it.

# Matching Algorithm Decisions

As our group designed a matching algorith with our three major factors, MBTI type, enneagram type, and name analysis, we 

# Login and Registration Decisions 

Our group wanted users to be able to view our site without logging in or creating an account first so that they can learn about the project and what the site offers, but we also did not want users to be able to take our test or view results without creating an account. Therefore, our website contains login and registration pages within the site, rather than when a user first enters the site (like how was implemented in the finance pset). 

# Other Layout Decisions

Our group wanted a simple yet effective layout for our website. We also wanted it to be clear for users how to use our site. 

# SQL Decisions

Our group wanted to challenge ourselves in regard to SQL so that we could learn to implement SQL in the future without being dependent on any CS50 imports. So, we used SQLite and created custom connections for our SQL databases. We created databases in order to store information about celebrities (their names, mbti type, enneagram type, a custom id, and a points value corresponding to the degree to which a celebrity is a match for a certain user)
